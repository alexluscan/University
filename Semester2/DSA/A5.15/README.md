# DSA-lab5

Implement in C++ the given container (ADT) using a given representation and a binary search 
tree (BST) as a data structure. You are not allowed to use any container or data structure from STL or 
from any other library.

Do not implement a separate class for the binary search tree (or for the dynamic array), 
implement the container directly!

16. ADT SortedList â€“ using a BST with linked representation on an array. Every node of the BST 
will retain the number of elements to the left of the node as well.
